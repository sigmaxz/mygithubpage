<h3> UCRSpoon </h3>
<p>An android app that mirrors UrbanSpoon for my Software Engineering course. Teamed up with four other classmates to deliver this product. Lets your browse restaurants, review/rate, upload pictures, and place orders. I worked on Backend(design Entity-Relationship database) and Frontend(Reviewing,Rating,Picture/Gallery,Google Maps API).

<h3> Server Authentication </h3>
<p> This was the final project for my Computer Secruity course. We were required to use C along with openssl to write a client and server program. Authentication was done using a cryptographically secure PRNG and RSA. Openssl is configured to not do any automatic authentication. Once connected and authenticated you can send or recieve files from the server.

<h3> Jet Propulsion Laboratory Internship </h3>
<p>As an intern I contributed to the evolution of support flight software for future missions. Knowing the difference between ilp32 and lp64 Datatype models was key. I hope that my work makes it into missions as the projected 2026.

<h3> Information Retrival Project </h3>
<p>In phase 1 of this project, we were required to build a Twitter crawler to collect 5 GB of data. The data that we collected was stored as JSON objects. In final phase of the project, we were required to parse through the JSON objects and build a searchable database for the tweets we gathered. We also created a simple web-based interface to display our results.

<h3> WhatsAppOnline with embedded Database</h3>
<p> This project called “WhatsAppOnline” is an instant messaging program that allows users to create and send messages to one or more users. Though this program does not have a GUI, its interface was carefully planned and thought out in order to think about how the User would naturally interact with an instant messaging service.
In our design, we created a main menu with multiple sub-menus. The purpose of this was to guide the User into intuitively selecting an option without feeling overwhelmed or confused by the interface; for instance, the User will intuitively know how to modify their contacts list by checking their Settings.

<h3> Research in High Performance Computing</h3>
<p> What i did for the research was go through one of Dr.Chens publications. I was to understand and implement my interpretation from their explanation. The topic is on Soft Error Correction. This is when there is an error in long term calculations that can be caught on runtime and then be recalculated 
with a lower time cost. 
</p>
<h3> Display Board </h3>
<p> A project lead by the IEEE chapter at UCR. They are making a interactive
 display using five monitors and Microsoft Kinect. There is a weather station team and game dev team.
 I was lead of the game creation team using Kinect's SDK. My team was to  provide a GUI which will
 be from which users will interact with both sides of the project. Upon taking up research I decided to step down from my role.</p>

<p> Description: This is a retro based shooter where you will have letters coming towards your 

ship. The goal is to collect letters that you will be using to solve a “hanged man” phrase. 

Destroy letters you don’t want enemies along the way. To win use the letters you have
